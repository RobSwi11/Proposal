Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So i figured out how to get python to read my excel file i made where i have been keeping track of my blood sugar and carbs I've been eating. I also figured out how to download new modules into python, and for this i downloaded matplotlib. This has allowed my to display my results, and each day I add information it will automatically update. The graph is also interactive so once i have accumulated a bunch of days i can zoom in and see specific data points and get a closer look at the graph. I have also written most of the functions for asking the various questions needed to figure out what i can eat, and if I need to take any insulin.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not tied all of the functions in to run together yet, but the basis for all of them is written.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

well the biggest problem for me was getting the graph to print out the way that i wanted it to. I had been trying to use the file reading we had done in class, but it did not work the way I had wanted. So i had to look on the internet to find a better way to have a CSV read and then produce a graph. That was when i came across using pandas and matplotlib. I hadn't known about them previously, but they did exactly what i wanted and then some!
